== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =

Go to Wordpress "Admin > Products > Rearrange Products" and use drag-and-drop functionality to arrange your products.
Click on "Sort by Categories" tab to arrange products by Categories.

= Can I undo the changes I have made after deactivating or deleting the plugin? =

1. Products rearranging CAN NOT be undone after deactivating or deleting the plugin if you are doing sorting on all products. As it directly updates the "menu_order" property of the products.
2. Products rearranging WILL BE undone after deactivating or deleting the plugin if you are doing sorting on products by categories.

== Troubleshooting ==

**If the sort order you changed is not working on your Shop page, please check below is set properly.**

1. Go to Wordpress Admin > Appearance > Customize
2. Select “Woocommerce” from left and go to “Product Catalogue”
3. Now here check for “Default Product Sorting”.
4. Make sure it is set to “Default sorting (custom ordering + name)”

**Some products are missing when sorted by categories? Follow the solution below:**

The workaround solution for this is to simply go to **Admin > Rearrange Products > Sort by Categories** and then select each category one by one from the Dropdown, and DON'T click the “Save” button. This will update all categories metadata into database one by one and will fix your issue. This is just a **one-time process** and it will fix your issue forever.
What is happening here is that the categories that you have not organized, don’t have metadata(for sort order) in the database. And because of that, some products don’t appear on those categories.

**If you have huge list of product and the plugin is not saving the sort order changes** 

Then it may be issue with PHP configuration done on your server for `memory_limit` and `max_execution_time`.
Ask your web hosting provider to increase `memory_limit` and `max_execution_time` and try updating sort order after that.

This will fix the issue.
